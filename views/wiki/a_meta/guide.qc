The first thing that you will have to do when playing is mine some ore, after all, this is Minecraft. You dig deep under the earth and soon find Quantonium Ore. You’re about to mine it but you notice that it is glowing with a high resolution texture. “What is this?” you ask. The developers started out with a normal ore with a colorful texture but soon got bored of it and wanted more. Instead of adding an entirely new system to get the ore they just went with making it look really awesome, as you may notice when you look at it. Once you get that shiny little drop called Raw Quantonium you’re ready to start getting some awesome machines.

The QuantumCraft machine systems are designed to work off its own power network which is based around sinks and sources. The sinks are machines that take in power and the sources are ones that emit it. To get power between machines you can either put the machines next to each other so that they touch or use Quantum Fibre Wire. Before you’re able to utilize anything in this network, you need some power. Remember that awesome drop you got from the ore? Yeah, the Raw Quantonium. Go ahead and stick that in a furnace and you’ll get some Crystallized Quantonium. You’re now going to want a machine that can generate power. The most efficient one is called the Quantum De-energizer. Once you craft that you just place it on the ground and put the crystal on the left side. The machine will start to process that and output a depleted crystal on the left. Currently there is no use for this item but there is an amazing planned feature for it. However, until that feature is added, when the machine’s output slot gets full it will start deleting the new depleted crystals rather than filling up your chests with something useless. Along with that, there is also one more thing it’s outputting. POWER! To see the amount of power in a machine you can look on the right where the blue power bar is. If it’s not blue then you don’t got no powa!

If you play with BuildCraft then the energy net may be confusing you. As I’ve already mentioned, it has sinks and sources. However there’s a little bit more to it. The sources have an internal buffer and if there’s nowhere for the power to go it just fills up with energy. However, even if there is somewhere to go, unless that machine is asking for power it won’t go there. This means that if you have a Quantum Energy Extractor (more information soon) and you are trying to take the energy out of a tool it may not finish taking the energy out because the machine’s buffer is full and it cannot put the power anywhere even though one of your other machines still has more room in his buffer.

Before you are able to use a Quantum Energy Extractor you’re going to need something that has power in it. These items are called “IQEnergizible” meaning that they interface with these machines. These include all the Quantum Tools and the Portable Capacitor. To get some power into these devices you need to craft a Quantum Energy Injector. Go ahead and do that to get started. When you place this block down you may notice a very simple GUI. The injector has a super high tech one compared to the other GUIs this is because it’s a sneak peek into what we’re doing for all the machines. Place one of these chargeable items on left and when it’s full it will go to the right. The Injector itself only has an internal buffer of 100 QEU (Quantum Energy Units) but quickly fills up when it needs more power. The Extractor is simply the opposite.

There are two machines are called the Quantum Electrifier and Quantum De-Electrifier. The electrifier will create BC energy and the De-electrifier will eat up BC energy and turn it into Quantum Energy. When you place down the Electrifier you’re going to need a few connections before you are able to use it. Obviously you need a power connection for QuantumCraft. Do the normal stuff. To get power out of the electrifier you place a buildcraft wooden kinesis pipe next to it. That will allow it to create energy. Simple? Yeah it is. The De-electrifier is even easier. You do the same thing but instead of a wooden pipe, you can use any other pipe.

You know that mining system I was talking about? Well, let’s learn about the awesomeness of it! The first thing is the ION Tunneler. This machine will build 9, 51x2 tunnels, each 3 blocks apart, with a connecting tunnel on both ends. The machine will build the tunnel in the direction in which you place it. The power costs are 1 QEU per block mined. This is a way to get tunnels in the ground for manual strip mining. It is cheaper than using the automated ION Scanning system.

Another block is the ION Scanner. That will scan an area 30 blocks around the scanner itself in every direction for ores. It costs 1 QEU per tick (20 ticks per second). You then need to place down an ION Harvester which will allow you to actually collect the ores. The harvester uses 5 QEU per block mined and a block is mined every 100/# ticks (20 ticks per second) where # is the number of harvesters you have. The harvester will place the drops from the ores either in a chest next to it or on the ground if it can’t find a chest.

Lastly, we have the ION Forge. This is simply a super fast, super expensive (in power terms) smelting machine that can cook two things at once. Plop it down stick something in on the left and see it get smelted and pop out on the right. The default power usage is 3 QEU per item you smelt.

That’s all that is currently enabled by default. We have a few other features that have to be enabled by going to the config file. To get there on windows you click WindowsKey + R and you can see the run dialog. Type %appdata% and you will see an explorer window pop up. Go to .minecraft/config and open the file QuantumCraft.cfg in your favorite normal text editor (NOT NOTEPAD). Change beta from false to true. Warning: This may break stuff. In fact, it most likely will break some things. Only use this if you are willing to take the risks.

Once you get back into the game you will see a few new things, the biggest one being the Quantum Dislocator. If you place this block down you can put 2 Location Cards in it. Now when you edit one of those blocks, the other will do the same. As I mentioned, this is BETA, it is very buggy and has a lot of problems. Currently it does NOT use power because we have not gotten it completely working. The Location Cards are very self explanatory, just craft it and follow the instructions on the tooltip (hover over it).

You’ll also notice a few other items and blocks. Most of them are useless as we haven’t finished them and are only stubs but there is one extra block that may be fun. That block is called the Quantum Energy Sucker. Guess what it does? It sucks energy, eating it up as fast a possible. As you may guess it is not craftable so you will have to cheat it in, but it is still a fun prank to play on your friend.

Head over to the Minecraft Forum Post and give some feedback on how it is and what you want next. I have been told that there are a few more things planned to be added that will blow your mind.
