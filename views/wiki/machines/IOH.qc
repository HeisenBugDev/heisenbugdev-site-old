The ION Harvester must be in the range of the ION Scanner to work. Place it down and connect it to power. It will collect the ores the ION Scanner finds and costs 5 QEU per block broken. It will either drop them next to the machine or into a chest next to it. The speed that the blocks will break is determined by the number of Harvesters you place. A block is broken every 100/#OfHarvesters ticks.
